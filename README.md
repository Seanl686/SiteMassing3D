# SiteMassing3D

A parametric 3D massing model of a double-wide, built to produce the plate images
that the site-render prompt in `../SITE-RENDER-PROMPT-TEMPLATE.md` asks for.

The point is not a pretty render. The point is **geometry you can trust**: the
front wall really is `L/W` times as long as the gable end, the roof ridge really
sits at the pitch you typed, and the exterior doors are really where the floor
plan puts them — including on the walls no photograph covers.

## Run it

```fish
cd SiteMassing3D
npm start          # serves on http://localhost:5173
```

Any static server works (`python3 -m http.server 5173` is wired up as `npm run serve`).
It must be served over HTTP — ES modules and the home library will not load from
a `file://` path.

No build step. `three` is vendored into `vendor/`; `node_modules/` is only there
so the vendored copy can be refreshed.

## The loop it is built for

1. Read the model's `W' x L'` off the spec sheet and type it into **Home**.
2. Set siding / trim / roof colors off the dealer-lot photo.
3. Place the **exterior doors** — this is the part a photograph can't give you.
   Load the floor plan as a plate, scale it to the footprint outline, and trace.
4. Hit **Front elev / Rear elev / Left end / Right end**, or **Render 4-view
   contact sheet** for all of them at once.
5. Feed those PNGs to the image model as the geometry reference, alongside the
   lot photo and the home photos.

The burnt-in caption carries the model name and `W × L`, so the plate answers the
"state the dimensions you read" step of the prompt template on its own.

## Controls

**Views** (top bar) — the four elevations and the plan use an orthographic camera,
so they measure true. The three-quarter and eye-level views use a perspective
camera with the focal length from the Scene panel, so they read like a photo.
Orbit/pan/zoom with the mouse at any time; once you move the camera yourself, the
presets stop re-fitting your framing on export.

**Openings** — click a wall to add at that spot, or use `+ Door / + Slider /
+ Window`. Click a door or window to select it:

| Action | Result |
|---|---|
| Drag the body | Move along the wall (windows also move vertically) |
| Drag a blue handle | Resize that edge |
| `Shift` while dragging | Lock to one axis |
| `Alt` while dragging | Turn off the 1″ snap |
| `Del` / `Backspace` | Delete the selection |

Every value is also typeable in the sidebar row. `Offset` is measured left→right
as you face that wall from outside.

**Floor plan plate** — load the spec-sheet PNG, set *Plate width (ft)* so the
printed footprint matches the blue outline (turn on *Dimension outline on ground*
to see it), then nudge Offset X/Z and Rotation until it lines up. With *Plan-pick
mode* on, clicking the plate drops a door on the nearest wall at that position.

**Screenshot** — set the pixel size, then *Render PNG*. *Fit pixel aspect to
current view* retargets the height so an elevation isn't 70% sky. *Transparent
background* gives you an alpha PNG to composite straight onto a lot plate.

## Home spec files

`Save JSON` writes the whole home — dimensions, colors, every opening — to a file.
Drop it in `homes/`, add a line to `homes/index.json`, and it shows up in the
**Library** dropdown.

`homes/_TEMPLATE.json` is the starting point. Its dimensions are placeholders:
**read the real `W' x L'` off the spec sheet rather than trusting them.**

```json
{
  "name": "Redmond 25610",
  "dimensions": {
    "widthFt": 27, "lengthFt": 56,
    "wallHeightFt": 8, "floorHeightFt": 2.5,
    "roofPitch": 4, "eaveOverhangFt": 1, "rakeOverhangFt": 0.75,
    "roofStyle": "gable"
  },
  "colors": { "siding": "#8d9299", "trim": "#f2f2f0", "roof": "#3a3d42",
              "skirting": "#e6e6e1", "door": "#f2f2f0", "glass": "#4d6070" },
  "openings": [
    { "id": "d1", "type": "door", "wall": "front",
      "offsetFt": 14, "widthFt": 3, "heightFt": 6.67, "sillFt": 0,
      "label": "Main entry" }
  ]
}
```

- `wall` — `front` and `back` are the long walls, `left` and `right` the gable ends.
- `type` — `door`, `slider`, or `window`.
- `offsetFt` — from the wall's left corner, viewed from outside.
- `sillFt` — above the floor deck, not above grade. Doors are pinned to 0.
- All lengths are feet; `6.67` is a 6'-8" door.

Because the format is plain JSON keyed to the spec sheet's own vocabulary, you
can hand a spec sheet PNG to Claude and ask it to write the file — model name,
`W' x L'`, and the door and window schedule read straight off the plan. Check the
result against the sheet before you trust a render made from it.

## Conventions inside the model

- One world unit is one foot. `+X` runs along the length, `+Z` across the width,
  `+Y` is up. The front wall faces `-Z`; the gable ends are at `±X`.
- Walls are extruded `THREE.Shape`s with a hole per opening, so an opening is a
  real void, not a decal — it stays correct at any camera angle.
- The gizmo overlay is excluded from every export.

## Known limits

- Single rectangular footprint. No L-shapes, dormers, porch roofs, or bay windows.
- One roof pitch, ridge always along the length.
- Massing-level materials: flat colors, no siding or shingle texture. That is
  deliberate — a textured render fights the lot photo's lighting, while a clean
  massing plate reads as a geometry reference.
